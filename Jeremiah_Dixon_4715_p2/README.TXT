RECORDING USER, CPU, AND SYSTEM TIME CODE I LEARNED/ BASED/ USE FROM - http://nadeausoftware.com/articles/2008/03/java_tip_how_get_cpu_and_user_time_benchmarking

THE TEST FILE IS A LARGE TEST FILE MY PROFESSOR GAVE US IN COMPUTER NETWORKS FOR AN ASSIGNMENT TO SEND A FILE OVER A TCP CONNECTION IN JAVA AND COPY IT AND CHECK IT FOR MISTAKES TO MAKE SURE THE CONNECTION IS RELIABLE. IT IS JUST A TON OF WORDS LIKE , 'THIS IS A TEST 1, THIS IS A TEST 2... ETC.'
